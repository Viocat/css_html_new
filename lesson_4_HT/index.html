                        that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After

                        with their themes of abjection and social alienation, brought them global popularity. Following

                        both the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. Nirvana disbanded following
                        Cobain's suicide in April 1994. Various posthumous releases have been overseen by Novoselic,
                        Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. The posthumous live album <a class="album-chart-mgzn"

                        Nirvana is one of the best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 75 million records
                        worldwide. During their three years as a mainstream act, Nirvana received an American Music
                        Award, Brit Award and Grammy Award, as well as seven MTV Video Music Awards and two NME Awards.
                        They achieved five number-one hits on the <a class="album-chart-mgzn" href="#">Billboard</a>
                        Alternative Songs chart and four number-one albums on the <a class="album-chart-mgzn"

                        named Nirvana among the 100 greatest artists of all time. They were inducted into the Rock and

                                    wanted to form a band with Novoselic, but<br>
                                    Novoselic did not respond for a long period. Cobain gave him a demo tape of his

                                    Fecal Matter. Three years after the two first met, Novoselic notified Cobain that he

                                    finally listened to the Fecal Matter demo and suggested they start a group. Their

                                    band, the Sellouts, was a Creedence Clearwater Revival tribute band.[4] The

                                    replacement on drums.[12] Foster's tenure with Nirvana lasted only a few months;

                                    a stint in jail, he was replaced by Burckhard, who again departed after telling

                                    he was too hungover to practice one day.[13] Cobain and Novoselic put an ad seeking

                                    week. <span class="crossline-deco">The following month, the band began recording its
                                        debut album, Bleach, with
                                        local producer Jack Endino.</span> [16] Bleach was influenced by the heavy
                                    dirge-rock of the
                                    Melvins, the 1980s punk rock of Mudhoney, and the 1970s heavy metal of Black
                                    Sabbath.[17] The money for the recording sessions for Bleach, listed as $606.17 on
                                    the album sleeve, was supplied by Jason Everman, who was subsequently brought into
                                    the band as the second guitarist. Though Everman did not play on the album, he
                                    received a credit on Bleach because, according to Novoselic, they "wanted to make
                                    him feel more at home in the band".[18] Prior to the album's release, Nirvana became
                                    the first band to sign an extended contract[clarification needed] with Sub Pop.[19]

                                    Bleach was released in June 1989, and became a favorite of college radio stations.
                                    Nirvana embarked on its first national tour,[20][21] but canceled the last few dates
                                    and returned to Washington state due to increasing differences with Everman. No one
                                    told Everman he was fired; Everman later said he had quit.[22] Although Sub Pop did
                                    not promote Bleach as much as other releases, it was a steady seller,[23] and had
                                    initial sales of 40,000 copies.[24] However, Cobain was upset by the label's lack of
                                    promotion and distribution.[23] In late 1989, Nirvana recorded the Blew EP with
                                    producer Steve Fisk.[25] In an interview with John Robb in Sounds, Cobain said the
                                    band's music was changing: "The early songs were really angry... But as time goes on
                                    the songs are getting poppier and poppier as I get happier and happier. The songs
                                    are now about conflicts in relationships, emotional things with other human
                                    beings."[26]

                                    Grohl performing in 1989
                                    In April 1990, Nirvana began working on their next album with producer Butch Vig at
                                    Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin.[27] Cobain and Novoselic became disenchanted
                                    with Channing's drumming, and Channing expressed frustration at not being involved
                                    in songwriting. As bootlegs of Nirvana demos with Vig began to circulate in the
                                    music industry and draw attention from major labels, Channing left the band.[28]
                                    That July, Nirvana recorded the single "Sliver" with Mudhoney drummer Dan
                                    Peters.[29] Dale Crover filled in on drums on Nirvana's seven-date American West
                                    Coast tour with Sonic Youth that August.[30]

                                    In September 1990, Buzz Osborne of the Melvins introduced the band to drummer Dave
                                    Grohl, whose Washington, D.C. band Scream had broken up.[31] Grohl auditioned for
                                    Novoselic and Cobain days after arriving in Seattle; Novoselic later said, "We knew
                                    in two minutes that he was the right drummer."[32] Grohl told Q: "I remember being
                                    in the same room with them and thinking, 'What? That's Nirvana? Are you kidding?'
                                    Because on their record cover they looked like psycho lumberjacks... I was like,
                                    'What, that little dude and that big motherfucker? You're kidding me'."[33]
